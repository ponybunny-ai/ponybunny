  ExecutionService per-work-item tool allowlist
    ✓ denies disallowed tool invocation when work item allowlist is restrictive (11 ms)
    ✓ keeps tool permissions isolated across concurrent runs

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total

Assertion summary:
- Restrictive allowlist deterministically denies disallowed tool invocation ("Action denied" path asserted in test).
- Concurrent runs with different allowlists remain isolated (allow-run succeeds, deny-run blocked, no permission leakage).
