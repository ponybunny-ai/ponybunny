F2 Code Quality Review
Date: 2026-02-18
Scope: Final Wave quality review using existing oracle/momus outputs and recorded task evidence

Verdict: PASS with minor follow-ups

Findings (Severity | Issue | File)
- Medium | Prior incomplete-success handling defect in ReAct flow has been fixed; include as resolved quality item | src/autonomy/react-integration.ts
- Low | Repeated non-fatal Jest environment warning (`--localstorage-file`) observed during multiple targeted runs; no assertion failures | test runs (environment-level)
- Low | Non-fatal startup environment warnings (gateway socket/playwright MCP connectivity) observed during bounded scheduler probes; startup-path assertions still passed | runtime environment probes
- Low | Limited LSP diagnostics coverage for JSON/Markdown/SQL due to missing language servers in environment | config/docs/sql files

Remediation Shortlist
- Keep a targeted regression test around ReAct completion-state transitions to prevent recurrence of incomplete-success behavior.
- Normalize local test runner flags/environment to reduce noisy Jest warnings.
- Add optional CI/static checks for JSON/Markdown/SQL linting where practical.

Conclusion
- Code quality is acceptable for final wave sign-off; no open high-severity defects remain in audited scope.
