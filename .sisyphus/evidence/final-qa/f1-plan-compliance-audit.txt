F1 Plan Compliance Audit
Date: 2026-02-18
Scope Audited: Tasks 17-23 + Final Wave

Verdict: PASS (Compliant)

Key Rationale
- Task 17-23 evidence is present and internally consistent with implemented outcomes (react_goal dispatch routing, per-work-item allowlist isolation, --agents gating/cutover, durable scheduling tests, and E2E scheduled dispatch coverage).
- Final wave runbook evidence confirms green verification gates for targeted Jest suites, E2E scheduling flow, and build/typecheck.
- No blocking regressions are recorded in final-wave artifacts; observed warnings are classified non-fatal and do not invalidate task acceptance criteria.

Key Gaps and Remediations
- Gap (Low): Environment emits repeated non-fatal Jest `--localstorage-file` warning.
  Remediation: Keep warning documented; treat as known environment noise unless assertions fail.
- Gap (Low): Historical startup probe instability (`__filename` runtime path) was observed earlier in wave.
  Remediation: Mark as resolved in final wave; retain bounded foreground startup probe in regression checks.

Conclusion
- Plan execution for tasks 17-23 and final-wave QA is compliant with expected deliverables and verification standards.
