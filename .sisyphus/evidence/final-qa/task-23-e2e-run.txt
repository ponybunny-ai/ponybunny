Final QA Evidence - Task 23 Scheduled-Agent E2E

Executed commands:
1. `npx tsx test/e2e-agent-scheduling.ts`
2. `bun run build`

Captured outputs:
- PASS: in-process scheduled-agent dispatch reached exactly one run.
- PASS: DB assertions satisfied for goal/work_item/cron_job_runs linkage and submitted status.
- $ tsc && cp src/infra/persistence/schema.sql dist/infra/persistence/

Verification assertions:
- Exactly one due dispatch was observed in deterministic E2E execution.
- Persistence assertions for goal/work item and cron_job_runs link/status succeeded.
- Build pipeline completed with the expected TypeScript + schema copy step.
