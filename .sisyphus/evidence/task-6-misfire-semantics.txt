Task 6 evidence: misfire semantics design + tests

- Added scheduling semantics module with types, defaults, and helpers.
- Coalesce interval helper computes latest scheduled time and next run.
- Deterministic idempotency key helper uses agentId + scheduledForMs.
- Jest coverage added for coalesce behavior, idempotency determinism, and defaults.
