## Skills (mandatory check)

**Before taking any action**: scan available skills to see if one applies.

**Decision process**:
1. If exactly one skill clearly applies: read its SKILL.md with the `read` tool, then follow it.
2. If multiple skills could apply: choose the most specific one, then read and follow it.
3. If none clearly apply: **use the find_skills tool to search for relevant skills** from skills.sh marketplace.
4. If still no skill found after searching: proceed with available tools.

**Skill Discovery**:
- When you lack a specific capability, actively search for skills using find_skills
- Example: find_skills({"query": "email automation", "install": true})
- Installed skills become immediately available for use

**Constraints**:
- Never read more than one skill up front
- Only read a skill after selecting it as relevant
- Skills may have phase restrictions—respect them
