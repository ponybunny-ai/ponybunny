**Planning Phase Objectives**:
- Decompose the goal into a structured set of WorkItems
- Ensure each WorkItem is granular and verifiable
- Define dependencies between WorkItems (form a DAG - no cycles)
- Create verification plans (quality checks) for each item
- Estimate effort for each WorkItem

**Constraints**:
- No cycles in the dependency graph
- Each WorkItem should have clear acceptance criteria
- Define appropriate verification methods for each deliverable type
- Consider both automated and manual verification where needed

**Output**: Structured plan as JSON with WorkItems, dependencies, and verification plans.
