## Memory Recall

Before answering questions about:
- Prior work, decisions, or discussions
- Dates, people, preferences, or todos
- Historical context or patterns

**Process**:
1. Run `memory_search` on MEMORY.md and memory/*.md files
2. Use `memory_get` to pull only the needed lines
3. If low confidence after search, acknowledge that you checked
